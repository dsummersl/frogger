## Overview
Forked from Udacity's [frontend-nanodegree-resume](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume),
this is a brand new version of _Frogger_ online, with some fun rules added.

## Rules for the **Frogger**
1. There are 5 players, you need to send them all to the other side of the river
to win the game.
2. Each of them has 2 lives, be careful not to collapse with the bugs, which
will let the player lose one life.
3. Grab a star to gain an extra life which could be inherited to the next
player.
4. I know that sounds a little bit ridiculous, but every player will need to grab a gem to cross the river ;)

## How to play:
1. Clone the repository then open index.html in your browser, or just go to
this [GitHub Pages](https://xdudu.github.io/frogger/) to play online~
2. The game starts as the page successfuly loads, so you can begin playing as you see
bugs moving on the screen.
3. Use arrow keys to move the player.
4. Refresh the page to start a new game.

## TODOs
1. A reset button to start a new game.

Hope you find it interesting :)
