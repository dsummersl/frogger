            <h2>Look Before Your Cross!</h2>
            <p>
            Chapel Hill has the reputation of being a very pedestrian friendly
            town, yet its major roads are pretty intimidating! This game models
            the lanes and 2015 traffic counts of Chapel Hill's
            pedestrian-friendly streets.
            </p>

            <p>
            Help our five school kids cross Chapel Hill's Streets as they wander
            the city.
            </p>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ul class="tip-list">
                <li>Use arrow keys to control the player.</li>
                <li>All five players need to cross the road to continue their journey.</li>
                <li>Refresh the page to have a new start.</li>
